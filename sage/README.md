SNOVA in SageMath
=============

This directory contains a sage script `snova.sage` implementing SNOVA. It generates correct KAT files. The scripts supports the SNOVA variant with rectangular signatures described in `SNOVA_2.2.pdf`.


In addition an `emat_snova.sage` script is provided that uses an alternative representation of the SNOVA public map. This version will create valid SNOVA KAT files as well as recreate the MAYO-1 KAT files if so configured. This script demonstrates that both SNOVA and MAYO are instances of Rectangular SNOVA.
